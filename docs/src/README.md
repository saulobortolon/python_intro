# Source code for code examples

This folder contains source code for most of the code
examples in the book. The most central examples of each chapter is included as
regular py-files, but many of the smallest examples have been omitted, since
these are easy to explore with copy-paste or in an interactive Python session.
Some of the code examples have been slightly changed compared with the version
in the book, either to fix minor bugs or to make the code give more sensible
output.
