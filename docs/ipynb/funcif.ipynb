    "# Functions and Branching\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter introduces two fundamental programming concepts: *functions* and *branching*.\n",
    "We are used to *functions* from mathematics, where we typically define a function $f(x)$ as\n",
    "some mathematical expression of $x$, and then we can then evaluate the function for different\n",
    "values of $x$, plot the curve $y=f(x)$, solve equations of the kind $f(x)=0$, and so on.\n",
    "A similar function concept exists in programming, where a function is a piece of\n",
    "code that takes one or more variables as input, carries out some operations using\n",
    "these variables, and produces output in return. The function\n",
    "concept in programming is more general than in mathematics, and is not restricted to\n",
    "numbers or mathematical expressions, but the general idea is exactly the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Branching*, or if-tests, is another fundamental concept that exists in all common\n",
    "programming languages. The idea is that decisions are made in the code based on the\n",
    "value of some Boolean expression or variable. If the expression evaluates to\n",
    "true, one set of operations is performed, and if the expression is false, a\n",
    "different set of operations is. Such tests are essential for controlling the\n",
    "flow of a computer program.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Programming with Functions\n",
