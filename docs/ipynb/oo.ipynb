    "# Object-Oriented Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon reading the chapter title, one could wonder why object-oriented programming\n",
    "(OOP) is introduced only now.  We have used objects\n",
    "since Chapter 2, and we started making our own\n",
    "classes and object types\n",
    "in Chapter 8, so what is new in Chapter 9? The answer is that\n",
    "the term OOP can have two different meanings.\n",
    "The first simply involves programming with objects and classes, which\n",
    "we introduced in Chapter 8, and is more commonly\n",
    "referred to as object-*based* programming. The second meaning\n",
    "of OOP is programming with *class hierarchies*, which are\n",
    "families of classes that inherit their methods and attributes from each other.\n",
    "This is the topic of the present chapter. We will learn how to collect\n",
    "classes in families (hierarchies) and let child classes inherit\n",
    "attributes and methods from parent classes.\n",

    "# Class Hierarchies and Inheritance\n",
    "A class hierarchy is a family of closely related classes organized in a\n",
    "hierarchical manner. A key concept is *inheritance*, which means that\n",
    "child classes can inherit attributes and methods from parent classes.\n",
    "A typical strategy is to write a general class as a base class (or parent class)\n",
    "and then let special cases be represented as subclasses (child classes).\n",
    "This approach can often save much typing and code duplication. As usual, we\n",
