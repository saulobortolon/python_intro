    "In this chapter, we will learn to visualize mathematical functions and the results of\n",
    "mathematical calculations. You have probably used a variety of different\n",
    "plotting tools in the past, and we will now do much of the same thing in Python.\n",
    "The way standard plotting tools work in Python is that we first compute a\n",
    "number of points lying on the curve we want to show and then draw straight\n",
    "lines between them. If we have enough points, the result looks\n",
    "like a smooth curve. For plotting mathematical functions, this approach\n",
    "can seem a bit primitive, since there are other tools we can use to simply\n",
    "type in a mathematical expression and have the curve plotted on the screen.\n",
    "However, the approach we use here is also much more flexible, since we can plot\n",
    "data when there is no underlying mathematical function, for instance, experimental\n",
    "data read from a file or results from a numerical experiment. To plot\n",
    "functions in Python, we need to learn about the package `matplotlib`, which is an\n",
    "extensive toolbox for plotting and visualization.\n",

    "# NumPy and Array Computing\n",
    "The standard way to plot a curve $y=f(x)$ is to draw straight lines between\n",
    "points along the curve, and for this purpose we need to store the coordinates of the points.\n",
    "We could use lists for this, for instance, two lists `x` and `y`, and most of the plotting tools\n",
    "we will use work fine with lists. However, a data structure known as an *array* is much more\n",
    "efficient than a list, and it offers a number of nice features and advantages. Computing\n",
    "with arrays is often referred to as *array computations* or *vectorized computations*, and these concepts\n",
    "are useful for much more than just plotting curves.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Arrays are generalizations of vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In high school mathematics, vectors were introduced as line segments with a\n",
    "direction, represented by coordinates $(x,y)$ in the plane or $(x,y,z)$ in space.\n",
    "This concept of vectors can be generalized to any number of dimensions,\n",
    "and we can view a vector $v$ as a general $n$-tuple of numbers;\n",
    "$v=(v_0,\\ldots,v_{n-1})$. In Python, we could use\n",
    "a list to represent such a vector, by storing component $v_i$ as\n",
    "element `v[i]` in the list. However, vectors are so useful and common in\n",
    "scientific programming that a special data structure has been created for them:\n",
    "the *NumPy array*. An array is much less flexible than a list, in that it\n",
    "has a fixed length (i.e., no `append`-method), and one array can only hold\n",
    "variables of the same type. However, arrays are also much more efficient to use in\n",
    "computations, and since they are designed for such use, they have a\n",
    "number of useful features that can shorten and clarify our code.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purpose of plotting, we will mostly use one-dimensional arrays, but an\n",
    "array can have multiple indices,\n",
    "similar to a nested list. For instance, a two-dimensional array $A_{i,j}$ can\n",
    "be viewed as a table of numbers,\n",
    "with one index for the row and one for the column, as follows:"

    "    software. The drawback of this approach is that it requires separately installed software\n",
    "    (e.g., *ImageMagick*) to create the movie and view the animation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Use a `FuncAnimation` object from Matplotlib. This approach uses a slightly more advanced feature of Matplotlib,\n",
    "    and can be considered a combination of the two approaches above. The animation\n",
    "    is played *live*, but it can also\n",

    "    externally installed software that needs to be installed separately and integrated with Matplotlib.\n",
    "\n",
    "### First alternative: Running the movie live as the plots are created.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is the simplest of the three and requires very few tools that we\n",

    "that are worth noting. First, we use the same `plot` function as earlier,\n",
    "but in a slightly different manner. Generally, this function\n",
    "does two things: it creates a plot that is ready to display on the screen by a subsequent call to `show()`,\n",
    "and it returns a special Matplotlib object that represents the plot (a `Line2D` object).\n",
    "In the  examples above, we did not need this object, so we did not care about it, but this time we store it\n",
    "in the variable `lines`.\n",
    "Note also that the `plot`-function always returns a list of such objects, representing all the curves\n",
    "of the plot. In this case, we plot\n",
    "only one curve, and the list has length one.\n",
    "To update the plot inside the for loop, we call the `set_ydata` method of this object,\n",
    "that is, `lines[0].set_ydata(y)`, every time we have computed a new `y` array.\n",
    "After updating the data, we call the function `draw()` to draw the curve on the\n",
    "screen. The final line inside the for loop simply makes the program stop and wait\n",
    "for 0.1 seconds. If we remove this call, the movie runs too fast to be visible,\n",
    "and we can obviously adjust the speed by changing the function's argument.\n",
    "As a final comment on this code, remember the important message from above, that we always need to fix the\n",
    "axes when creating movies; otherwise, Matplotlib will adjust the axes\n",
    "automatically for each plot,\n",
    "and the resulting movie will not really look like a movie at all. Here, we compute the maximum value that the\n",
    "function will obtain in the line `max_f = f(m, m, s_stop)` (based on either prior\n",
    "knowledge about the Gaussian function or inspection of the mathematical expression). This value is then used to set the axes\n",
    "for all the plots that make up the movie.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Second alternative: Saving image files for later processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is very similar to the one above, but,\n",
    "instead of showing the plots on the screen,\n",
    "we save them to files, using the `savefig` function from Matplotlib. To avoid\n",
    "having each new plot over-write the previous file, we must include a counter variable and\n",
    "a formatted string to create a unique filename for each iteration of the for loop.\n",
