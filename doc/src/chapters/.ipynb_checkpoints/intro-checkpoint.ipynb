    "To actually write and run such a program, Python offers a number of different options.\n",

    "To write and run the \"Hello world!\"-program open your favourite\n",

    "with a suitable filename, for instance `hello.py`.[^Install] Then, open a terminal or\n",

    "`python hello.py` if you are using a regular terminal, or `run hello.py` if you\n",
    "are using iPython. The output appears in the terminal right after the command.\n",
    "If you are using an IDE, this is essentially an editor and an iPython/terminal\n",
    "window combined. For instance, in the popular Spyder IDE the editor is usually\n",
    "in the upper left window, while the window in the lower right corner is the\n",

    "and that you have installed the right version. It also introduces the\n",

    "illustrates how we use quotes to define a `string` in Python. While `print` is\n",
    "a word that Python understands, *hello* and *world* are not. By using the\n",
    "quotes we tell Python that it should not try to understand (or interprete)\n",

    "of the \"Hello world!\"-example would look something like this:"

    "it also has some small drawbacks. One of the more important ones is tightly\n",
    "linked to its main advantages, of being a flexible high-level language with\n",
    "intuitive syntax. Writing small programs in such a language\n",
    "can be very quick, and beginners can quickly start writing useful\n",
    "programs, but the downside is that the code can get messy as the\n",
    "programs grow in size and complexity.\n",
    "Other languages like C, C++ and Java enforces more structure in the code,\n",
    "which can be confusing for beginners and annoying when you want to write a\n",
    "small program quickly, but can\n",
    "be more efficient in the long run when writing larger programs. However, it is\n",
    "certainly possible to write neat and nicely structured programs in Python as\n",
    "well, but this requires a choice of the programmer to follow certain\n",
    "principles of coding style, and is not forced by the language itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another slightly annoying aspect of Python is that it exists in different\n",
    "versions. At the time of writing this Python 3 has been dominant\n",
    "for quite a while, but if you look for programming resources online or read\n",
    "older textbooks you may find many examples using Python 2. One excellent resource for\n",
    "scientific Python (on which this book is largely based)\n",
    "is \"A Primer on Scientific Programming with Python\", by\n",
    "Hans Petter Langtangen [[primer]](#primer). However, the latest\n",
    "version of that book was written in 2016, and it is still\n",
    "Python 2. For the mathematics-centred programming covered here\n",
    "the difference between Python 2 and Python 3 is fairly small, and [[primer]](#primer)\n",
    "is still a very useful resource and supplement to the\n",
    "present book. However, some differences are important to be aware\n",
    "of, and the most obvious one is how print-statements are written. In Python 2, the\n",
    "program above would read `print \"Hello world\"`, i.e. without\n",
    "the parentheses. Since nearly all the examples in [[primer]](#primer)\n",
    "use print-statements to write text and numbers to the screen, they will\n",
    "stop with an error message if you try to run them using Python 3. In most cases the only\n",
    "error is the missing parentheses, so adding parentheses to all the print statements\n",
    "will make most of the examples run fine in Python 3. We will comment on\n",
    "some of the other differences between the Python versions later."
