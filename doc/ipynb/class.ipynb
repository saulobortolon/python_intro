    "# Classes\n",
    "In this chapter, we introduce classes, which is a fundamental concept in programming.\n",
    "Most modern programming languages support classes or similar concepts, and we\n",
    "have already encountered classes earlier in this book. Recall, for instance,\n",
    "from Chapter 2 how we can check the type of a variable with the `type` function,\n",
    "and the output will be of the form  `<class 'int'>`,  `<class 'float'>`, and so on.\n",
    "This simply states that the type of an object is defined in the form of a class.\n",
    "Every time we create, for instance, an integer variable in our program, we create\n",
    "an object or *instance* of the `int` class. The class defines how the objects\n",
    "behave and what methods they contain. We have used a large number of different methods bound\n",
    "to objects, such as the `append` method for list objects and `split` for strings.\n",
    "All such methods are part of the definition of the class to which the object\n",
    "belongs. So far, we have only used Python's built-in classes to create\n",
    "objects, but in this chapter we will write our own classes and use them to\n",
    "create objects tailored to our particular needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Basics of Classes\n",
    "A class packs together data and functions in a single unit. As\n",
    "seen in previous chapters, functions that are bound to a class or an object\n",
    "are usually called methods, and we will stick to this notation in the present chapter.\n",
    "Classes have some similarity with modules, which are also collections of variables and functions that naturally\n",
    "belong together. However, while there can be only a single instance of a module, we can create multiple instances of a\n",
    "class. Different instances of the same class can contain different data, but\n",
    "they all behave in the same way and have the\n",
    "same methods. Think of a basic Python class such as `int`; we can create many integer variables in a program, and they\n",
    "obviously have different values (data), but we know that they all have the same general behavior and the same\n",
    "set of operations defined for them. The same goes for more complex Python classes\n",
    "such as lists and strings; different objects contain different data, but they all\n",
    "have the same methods. The classes we create in this chapter behave in exactly\n",
    "the same way.\n",
    "\n",
    "### First example: A class representing a function.\n",

    "To start with a familiar example, we return to the formula calculating\n",
