    "In this chapter we will introduce classes, which is a fundamental concept in\n",
    "programming. Most modern programming languages support classes or similar concepts,\n",
    "and we have already used classes extensively throughout this book. Recall\n",
    "for instance how we could check the type of a variable with the `type` function,\n",
    "and the output would be on the form `<class 'int'>`,  `<class 'float'>`, etc.\n",
    "This simply states that the type of an object is defined in the form of a class.\n",
    "Every time we create for instance an integer variable in our program, we create\n",
    "an object or *instance* of the `int` class. The class defines how the objects\n",
    "behave and what methods they contain. We have used a number of different methods bound\n",
    "to objects, such as the `append` method for list objects, `split` for strings,\n",
    "and many more. All such methods are part of the definition of the class that the\n",
    "object belongs to. So far we have only used Python's builtin classes to create\n",

    "are usually called methods, and we will stick to this notation in the present chapter.\n",
    "Classes have some similarity with modules, which are also collections of variables and functions that naturally\n",
    "belong together. However, while there is only a single instance of a module, we can create multiple instances of a\n",
    "class. Different instances of the same class may contain different data, but\n",
    "they all behave in the same way and have the\n",
    "same methods. Think of a basic Python class like `int`; we can create many integer variables in a program, and they\n",
    "obviously have different values (data), but we know that they all have the same general behavior and the same\n",
    "set of operations defined for them. The same goes for more complex Python classes like lists and strings; different\n",
